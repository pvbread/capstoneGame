## Summary
[Live link to DOCUMENTATION for the engine](https://pvbread.github.io/hierarchy.html "Engine Docs Page")

We tried to make a loosesly coupled game engine and game (although there are some tight couplings, notable with state management).
Since the game was an RPG, most of our engine functionalities aimed to work towards that end.

## Structure

Final Game and Game Engine have our final version of the project.
You can click on the link above for documentation of the game engine.
The demos folder houses the demos we did both in the final mvp demo and in the midterm.
All Unit tests can be found in everything_else/PyToCMigration/test.
The everything else folder has all our preparatory work (including tangential trials). At different points you may
find files marked "learning folders" with some toy model attempts at small ideas.
